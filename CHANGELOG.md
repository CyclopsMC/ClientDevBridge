# Changelog

All notable changes to ClientDevBridge are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Phase 1 — headless boot and screenshots

- `BridgeServer`: a localhost-only WebSocket endpoint, started from the client setup hook and only
  when `-Dclientdevbridge.enabled=true`. Implemented directly on `java.net` because Minecraft ships
  Netty without `netty-codec-http`, so `websocketx` is not on the classpath.
- A JSON-RPC 2.0 `Dispatcher` with a handler registry and the `hello` handshake.
- Handlers: `status`, `screenshot`, `wait.ticks`, `log.tail`.
- `mcadapter`: frame capture, the coordinate spaces, the tick clock, and the client-thread
  scheduling rule, isolated from the protocol and handler layers.

### Phase 0 — skeletons

- Multiloader project (Fabric and NeoForge) laid out like CyclopsMC/Flopper, for Minecraft 1.21.1.
- `e2e/consumer`: a minimal consumer mod used as the end-to-end test bed where Flopper cannot be built.
